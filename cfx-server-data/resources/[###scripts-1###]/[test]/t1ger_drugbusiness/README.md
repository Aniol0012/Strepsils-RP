### Protection
Do not touch or delete **protection_cl.lua** and **protection_sv.lua**. This is security. Upon deleting/corruption these, script will not work.

### Spawned Shells
- The shell spawns does not use predefined spot. It spawns the shell underneath the door pos and it checks for existing objects. 

### Supplies & Stock
- Players can get supplies into their business in two ways:
1) Purchase supplies; this simply refills the business supplies to its maximum. Configurable amount of price per level.
2) Steal supplies; this reminds of t1ger_drugs with the jobs, where to steal a van and bring it back. This adds one level of supplies. More jobs may come in the future!

- Supplies are then over time produced into stock. The wait time is configurable in config file. One level of supplies is turned into one level of stock.

- Stock can be sold when business has at least one level of stock. However, the more stock the player has, the better the payout.
